# Question

`app.get(endpoint, controller)` takes in a `controller` as the second argument.

What is a controller?

# Answer

A controller is a callback function that takes in the request from the endpoint, processes it and sends back a response. For example, with the endpoint `'/api/hello'`, if we have the following controller:

```js
const serveHello = (req, res, next) => {
  res.send("hello");
};
```

When we hit the endpoint, it will run this controller which will send the string `'hello'` as a response.
